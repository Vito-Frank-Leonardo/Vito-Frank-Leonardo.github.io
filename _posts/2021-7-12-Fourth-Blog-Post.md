title: Thoughts about Project 2 from ST558!
---

### Outlining the Project

In this project, my partner and I read and summarized bike sharing data then built models to predict the count of bike users in any given day. We first cleaned the data for model development then created a test and training set. After exploring the data with numerical summaries, tables, and plots, we fit 4 models. We fit two regression models, a random forest model, and a boosted tree model. After fitting all 4 models, we validated our models with the test set and computed the Test MSE. We used the MSE to determined which model was the best for the day. Lastly, we automated R markdown to complete this analysis for all 7 weekdays. 

### What would you do differently?

If I were to do this project again, I do not think that I would do much differently. I may have used the Caret package to fit the linear models instead of the lm function though.

### What was the most difficult part for you?

The most difficult part for me was defining the tuning grid for the ensamble models. 

### What are your big take-aways from this project?

My big take-away from this project is that building the right model for the data is not as straight forward as it seems in textbooks. It requires a lot of judgement and expertise.
