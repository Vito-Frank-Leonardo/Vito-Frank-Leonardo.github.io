title: Thoughts about R!
---
# What are your thoughts on R vs whatever other software you've used?  
I have used SAS, Python, and C++. R is less structured than SAS and it gives more freedom to the programmer but it is also better designed for statistics than Python and C++. 

# What functionality do you like about R?  
I like that R is vectorized and allows for easier use of mathematics than SAS and Python. 

# What parts do you miss about your other language?  
I miss that SAS has one standard way to solve every problem while R has many. It makes it hard to remember which packages to library and which functions to use. 

#Do you consider R a difficult language to learn? (If you knew R prior to the course, describe your experience when first learning it.)
I do not find R a difficult language. Once I got the hang of it, it actually is the easiest for me. I found Python and SAS significantly easier to learn at the beginning but R was much easier than C++ and Java.
