### What (if anything) has changed about what you think a data scientist is and what they do?

I do not think much has changed in my opinion of what a data scientist does (from this course). The course did however clarify how data scientists build and implement models. 


### What your current thoughts are in terms of using R for data science - do you think you'll continue to use R going forward?  Why or why not?

I think that most of what we learned is incredible useful even if we are not working in data science. The tidyverse is incredibly efficient and easy to read. R Markdown is an essential tool for a statistician to document results. Caret package is a great way to implement models. I think as long as my future employer allows it, I think that I will continue using R going forward. I am more comfortable in R than I am SAS or Python. The language feels like it is designed for data science and statistics while Python feels like a general programming language that users modify with packages to do statistics. If I was coming into data science from a computer science or software engineering background, I would most definately prefer Python. But as a statistician, I prefer R.  

### What things are you going to do differently in practice now that you've had this course?

The course changed how I use R. Learning how to use the GitHub repo to improve project workflow and R markdown to create documents really improved my productivity. I will continue to use GitHub and R Markdown to document and track my progress as I work through many projects.
