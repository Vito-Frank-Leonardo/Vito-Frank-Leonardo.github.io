title: Thoughts about Data Science!
---

Being a data scientist is about gathering large amounts of data from various sources and using the data to make meaningful predictions that a business can use to make profititable decisions. 

The major duties of a data scientist are to use data to solve a business problem; they do this by gathering the data by various methods (such as web scraping) then picking a machine learning model that has the best prediction accuracy for this data. The knowledge areas neccesary are statistics and applied mathematics to understand the machine learning models and methods, programming to impliment these methods and gather data, and domain knowledge of the business to answer questions sufficiently. 

Data scientists and statisticians are similar in the fact that they both apply statistical methods to data to gain insights. However, they differ in their goals and methods. The goal of a data scientist is to make predictions; the goal of a statistician is to quantify uncertainty. The major method used by data scientists is to test different models on the data to see which fits the data the best; the major method used by statisticians is to fit the simplest model possible and then add complexity as needed to satisfy assumptions. For data scientists, prediction is the primary goal and interpretability is an after thought; for statisticians, interpretability is required to make sound inferences while prediction is usually an after thought. 

Personally, I view myself as somewhere in between these two areas. Certain problems may need to be solved from a data science perspective and for others, a statistician's approach may be better suited. For most problems, I believe the approach is somewhere in the middle. I personally feel more comfortable working with observational data and large datasets, similar to a data scientist would, but I also enjoy the mathematical rigor that comes with a statisticians inferences. I would not be able to choose sides this early in my career but, as one of the articles points out, data science and statistics seem to be merging and may become one in the near future so the choice may not be mine to make.
