My name is Vito; I am a graduate student at **North Carolina State University** pursuing a *Master of Statistics* degree. I have a *Bachelor of Science in Quantitative Economics* with a minor in Mathematics from **Queens College, CUNY**. My coursework was concentrated in Financial Economics and Econometrics. I have 1.5 years of academic research experience in the field of Economics and am currently the *Chair of the Institutional Review Board* at the **International Socioeconomic Laboratory at Harvard University**. After graduating in August, 2021, my goal is to apply my knowledge and skills to quantitative role in the finance industry.    

### My Interests

As an undergrad, I enjoyed the topics of *Finance and Economics* but I could not enjoy the work that many in the traditional finance industry do. However, I also enjoyed *Mathematics and Statistics* so I found a happy medium in **Econometrics**. This coursework and research experiences exposed me to *Regression Analysis*, *Longitudinal Data*, *Time Series Analysis*, and programming in *Python* and *R*. This inspired me to pursue my *Master of Statistics* degree at **NCSU**. 

My favorite types of models to build are **time series models** (*ARIMA*, *VAR*, *GARCH*, etc) and models for **longitudinal data** (*GLS*, *LME*, etc). I love the ability to use data to model trends, predict future events, analyze variabilty, and quantify uncertainty about relationships between variables. I think statistics is **POWERFUL** and **EXCITING**!

I also really enjoy developing the mathematical statistics and theory behind many of these models. ST501 and 502 were my favorite courses and I hope to take more mathematical statistics courses in the future as I continue my education. 

### My Motivation

I grew up in Queens, NY but I relocated to Central Florida in March of 2020 when the COVID-19 pandemic made me lose my job and NYC rent/living conditions became unbearable. I have a 16 month old son named Luca and a wife named Myrtle. Here is a picture of us at his baptism in January:

I hope to be employed full time by September so I can move my family into a better home near Tampa, Fl. Once I have a stable income, I hope to move my mother down from NY to come live with us so that she can retire and spend quality time with my son. Here is a picture of them together:

They have a great relationship and I cannot wait to reunite them again!
